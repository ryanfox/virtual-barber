Virtual Barber was created by Ryan Fox (ryan@foxrow.com) and Tyler Ambroziak (wrambro@gmail.com) for the final project of Prof. Chuck Dyer's CS638 class in the spring semester of 2010.

Our goal was to create an application in MATLAB to take a head shot of a bearded person and programmatically "shave" the subject.  We succeeded in creating a prototype, however there were still possible improvements to be made after the class concluded.  Our code is preserved here in case anybody would want to either improve it or use it for their own purposes.

In our original project we used two sets of pictures, each comprising a subset of all faces: bearded and non-bearded subjects.  These were taken from the Carnegie-Mellon PIE (Pose, Illumination, Expression) database.  We were granted permission to use the photos for educational purposes, however, as the project is no longer active, I am including them in src/b/ and src/nb/.  There is a third directory, src/nb_subspace, which contains the normalized images generated by us in creating the non-bearded subspace.

The media/ directory contains all image results generated by our program, as well as our final presentation and paper on the subject.
